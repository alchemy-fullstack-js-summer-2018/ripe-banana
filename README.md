This is a database of movies with reviews, movie studios, actors, reviews, and reviewers. It was written using Mongoose/Node/Express, and tested with Mocha/Chai!

## Get Started
1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Run `npm i` inside the directory to install all the necessary packages.
1. Make your own .env with the correct MongoDB URI and a port of your choice. Look at the `.env.example` file as a guide. You'll need a copy in the root directory and one in the `test` directory as well.
1. In a new terminal window, run your Mongo server.
1. Run `npm start` to start the server.
1. Run `npm run test:watch` to run the tests and build the necessary collections in your MongoDB.
